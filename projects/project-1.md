During my work at Hydrological Institute I proposed a hypothesis about posibility to reconstruct gaps (e.g. clouds) in remote sensing imagery by establishing relationships between pixels based on archived data and machine learning techniques.

We have implemented opensource [software toolbox](https://github.com/Dreamlone/SSGP-toolbox) and test it for different datasets: LST, Albedo, NDVI. Optimistic results were obtained, and I used this algorithm when creating a continuous series of various parameters of the Earthâ€™s surface
