Under guidance of prof. Dmitry Pozdnyakov at NIESRC we conducted large-scale study about coccolithophores blooms and how they affect global climate system. Large satellite dataset for 20 years was collected and processed with authorial algorithms together with in-situ measurements.

We have prepared and published database of calculated blooms. Then we analyzed which factors affects blooms and how it is possible to predict them with machine learning techniques.
